# Machine Learning

### Processing in Machine Learning

- Data Proprocessing
- Modeling Data
- Evaluation

### Feature Scaling

Scaling guarantees that all features are on a comparable scale and have comparable ranges.

1. Normalization - scale the range in between [0,1]

```
x' = x - min(x) / max(x) - min(x)
```

2. Standardization

```
x' = x - avg(x) / deviation(x)
```

### Data Preprocessing

- Importing Liabraries
- Importing Dataset
- Missing data handling
- Encoding data
- Splitting data
- Feature Scaling
